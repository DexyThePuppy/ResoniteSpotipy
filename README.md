## How to setup your Spotify application
**You'll need Spotify Premium to be able to do this!**
- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
- Click on "Create app"
- Give it a name, description, and ensure that you have a redirect URL for the application (I recommend putting both of these in: "http://localhost:8000/callback" and "http://localhost:8000")
- Once created, go to the application's Settings panel
    - Here's where you'll find the application's Client ID and, by clicking on the "view client secret" button, the Secret ID

## How to setup the websocket server
- Download the ZIP package in the files and unzip it
- Run the `ResoniteSpotipy.exe` executable in the ZIP file
  - On first run, it will generate an IDs.txt template file if one doesn't exist
  - Edit the IDs.txt file with your Spotify application's Client ID, Secret ID, and Redirect URI
  - Make sure the port ID you choose is not the same as the callback URI port
- Restart the application after editing the IDs.txt file

## How to setup the Resonite websocket client
- Spawn out the item from the folder
- Click on the Spotify tab to link up the player to the websocket server
    - Make sure you supply the same port ID as the one you're using for the websocket server!
